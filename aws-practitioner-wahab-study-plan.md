# Study Plan for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam :sparkler:

#### Note: Please follow steps 1-4 in the order listed. Trust me, this will guarantee your success! :slightly_smiling_face:

## 1. Take this AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (Second Edition) Digital Course

- This is a free course provided by AWS that offers video modules explaining key details all about the AWS Cloud (ex: intro, core and integrated services, security, pricing and billing strategies), and a final course knowledge check. I highly recommend taking this course (it takes about a couple days to a week to finish, it’s all self-paced). This course gives you 95% of the background knowledge about AWS from a Cloud Practitioner perspective.

## 2. Watch this YouTube video – AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Training 2020 Full Course

- I used this video as a supplement to the above course just to get a different perspective about the exam content itself. You don’t have to sit through this entire video, but just watch specific topics of it to completely soak up the knowledge.

## 3. Read this Study Guide

- I was Googling for study guides, and came across this one. I think this is a great guide that puts together everything you learned from the above videos and courses, and helps you retain all of that knowledge.

## 4. Take this Udemy Course with 6 Full Practice Exams

- This Udemy course was a major key to my success in getting the certification. There are 6 full-length practice exams, and they accurately represent the official exam content and. The best thing that I like about this course is that this particular course regularly goes back and updates the exam contents to reflect what questions/material is upcoming on the latest exam. Meaning, as the years go by, you can keep revisiting this course to get recertified, and never have to buy another course just because the upcoming year’s exams get updated. Plus, for each and every question it gives you a detailed explanation of the right/wrong answer choices. 

- <b>Note:</b> You will need to create a Udemy account (if you don’t already have one), and buy this course. Once you buy this course, you gain lifetime access to it.
